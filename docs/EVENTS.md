# Event System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the event system architecture for the Solana Bot project. The system is designed to be dynamic, extensible, and maintainable while handling complex trading operations.

## Core Philosophy
The system is designed around three key principles:
- **Adaptability**: Events can evolve without breaking existing functionality
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying core code
- **Discoverability**: System behavior is transparent and self-documenting

## Key Components

### Event Schema Registry
- Acts as a "source of truth" for event definitions
- Manages versioning and evolution of event types
- Provides runtime validation of event structures
- Enables automatic migration between versions
- Allows dynamic registration of new event types

### Dynamic Event Structure
- Flexible core event format that can adapt over time
- Self-describing metadata system
- Extensible properties that don't break existing handlers
- Built-in support for event relationships and tracking
- Custom fields can be added without schema changes

### Handler Registry
Think of this as a "smart router" for events:
- Dynamic registration of event handlers at runtime
- Priority-based processing
- Conditional handling based on event properties
- Versioning support for handlers
- Built-in retry and timeout mechanisms

### Plugin System
Like a "middleware layer" that can:
- Intercept and modify events at various stages
- Add cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, etc.)
- Extend system functionality without core changes
- Enable/disable features dynamically
- Provide hooks for custom processing logic

### Channel System
Think of this as "smart event streams":
- Creates logical groupings of related events
- Enables different processing rules per channel
- Supports filtering and transformation
- Handles backpressure and buffering
- Allows priority-based routing

### Configuration Management
The "control center" that:
- Manages system behavior at runtime
- Enables dynamic updates to system settings
- Provides monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Stores and loads different configurations
- Watches for changes and updates components

## Key Benefits

### For Developers
- Easy to add new event types
- Simple handler registration
- Clear event validation
- Built-in versioning support
- Flexible extension points

### For Operations
- Runtime configuration changes
- Monitoring and metrics built-in
- Dynamic scaling capabilities
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization options

### For Business
- Rapid feature deployment
- System evolution without downtime
- Easy integration of new requirements
- Reliable event processing
- Audit and compliance support

## Real-World Example

### Trading System Event Flow

1. **Price Update Received**
   - Event captured with metadata
   - Validated against schema
   - Routed to appropriate channels
   - Processed by registered handlers

2. **Multiple Handlers Process Event**
   - Trading strategy evaluation
   - Risk assessment
   - Position updates
   - Notification generation

3. **Plugins Add Functionality**
   - Audit logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Compliance checks

4. **System Adapts to Changes**
   - New trading rules added via plugins
   - Handler priorities adjusted
   - Channel configurations updated
   - New event types registered

## Evolution Capabilities

The system can evolve in several ways:

### Horizontal Evolution
- Add new event types
- Create new handlers
- Define new channels
- Install new plugins

### Vertical Evolution
- Enhance existing events
- Upgrade handler logic
- Improve channel processing
- Update plugin behavior

### Runtime Evolution
- Change configurations
- Adjust priorities
- Modify routing rules
- Update validation rules

## Scaling Considerations

The system is designed to scale across:

### Volume
- Multiple processing channels
- Buffering and backpressure
- Priority-based processing
- Load balancing support

### Complexity
- Plugin architecture
- Flexible event structure
- Dynamic configuration
- Versioning support

### Features
- Easy handler addition
- Plugin extensibility
- Channel configuration
- Schema evolution

## Event Types

### Market Events
- Price Updates
- Liquidity Changes
- Trading Status Changes
- Market Depth Updates

### Trading Events
- Order Creation
- Order Execution
- Order Cancellation
- Trade Settlement

### Risk Events
- Limit Breaches
- Exposure Warnings
- Risk Level Changes
- Position Updates

### System Events
- Configuration Changes
- Health Status Updates
- Error Notifications
- Performance Metrics

## Implementation Guidelines

### Event Creation
1. Define event schema
2. Register with Schema Registry
3. Implement validation rules
4. Create necessary handlers
5. Configure routing rules

### Handler Implementation
1. Define handler interface
2. Implement processing logic
3. Configure retry policies
4. Set up error handling
5. Register with Handler Registry

### Plugin Development
1. Implement plugin interface
2. Define hook points
3. Add configuration options
4. Test plugin behavior
5. Deploy and enable

## Best Practices

### Event Design
- Keep events focused and atomic
- Include necessary context
- Version from the start
- Plan for evolution
- Document clearly

### Handler Design
