# Factory-Based Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines our factory-based approach to building the Solana Bot application. We use factories as the primary pattern for creating and managing system components, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and testability.

## Core Philosophy
- **Simplicity**: Clear, straightforward interfaces
- **Consistency**: Standardized creation patterns
- **Reliability**: Built-in validation and error handling
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and verify
- **Maintainability**: Centralized creation logic

## Factory Types

### 1. Event Factory
Creates and manages all system events.

```plaintext
Responsibilities:
- Event creation
- Validation
- Metadata handling
- Context enrichment
- Relationship management

Examples:
- Market events (price updates, liquidity changes)
- Trading events (orders, executions)
- System events (status, health)
- User events (actions, preferences)
```

### 2. Service Factory
Manages service instantiation and lifecycle.

```plaintext
Responsibilities:
- Service creation
- Dependency injection
- Configuration
- Lifecycle management
- Health monitoring

Examples:
- Trading service
- Risk management service
- Portfolio service
- Market data service
```

### 3. Strategy Factory
Creates and manages trading strategies.

```plaintext
Responsibilities:
- Strategy instantiation
- Parameter management
- Risk rule integration
- Performance monitoring
- State management

Examples:
- Market making strategies
- Arbitrage strategies
- Trend following strategies
- Custom strategies
```

### 4. Repository Factory
Manages data access and persistence.

```plaintext
Responsibilities:
- Repository creation
- Connection management
- Query building
- Cache management
- Transaction handling

Examples:
- Order repository
- Trade repository
- Market data repository
- User repository
```

## Factory Implementation Pattern

### Creation Flow
```plaintext
1. Request Creation
2. Validate Input
3. Apply Defaults
4. Enrich/Transform
5. Validate Result
6. Return Instance
```

### Error Handling
```plaintext
Approach:
- Clear error messages
- Type validation
- Business rule checking
- State validation
- Resource checking
```

### Lifecycle Management
```plaintext
Stages:
1. Initialization
2. Configuration
3. Validation
4. Active Use
5. Cleanup/Disposal
```

## Factory Usage Examples

### Event Creation
```plaintext
Example Flow:
1. Request order event creation
2. Validate order parameters
3. Add system metadata
4. Enrich with context
5. Validate final event
6. Return event instance
```

### Service Creation
```plaintext
Example Flow:
1. Request trading service
2. Load configuration
3. Initialize dependencies
4. Configure service
5. Start service
6. Return service instance
```

### Strategy Creation
```plaintext
Example Flow:
1. Request strategy creation
2. Load parameters
3. Initialize components
4. Configure risk rules
5. Validate setup
6. Return strategy instance
```

## Best Practices

### Factory Design
```plaintext
Guidelines:
1. Single responsibility
2. Clear interfaces
3. Strong validation
4. Error handling
5. Performance awareness
```

### Usage Patterns
```plaintext
Principles:
1. Use factories for all creation
2. Validate early
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Monitor performance
5. Log important events
```

### Testing Approach
```plaintext
Strategy:
1. Mock factory outputs
2. Test creation paths
3. Verify validation
4. Check error handling
5. Measure performance
```

## Factory Integration

### System Components
```plaintext
Integration Points:
- Service layer
- Event system
- Data access
- Business logic
- External interfaces
```

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
```plaintext
Handled Aspects:
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Security
- Performance
- Error handling
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Factories
```plaintext
Process:
1. Define factory purpose
2. Design interface
3. Implement validation
4. Add error handling
5. Write tests
```

### Extending Existing Factories
```plaintext
Approach:
1. Review current usage
2. Plan changes
3. Update validation
4. Extend tests
5. Document changes
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
```plaintext
Metrics:
- Creation time
- Success rates
- Error rates
- Resource usage
- Cache hits/misses
```

### Health Checks
```plaintext
Validations:
- Factory availability
- Resource status
- Error conditions
- Performance thresholds
- System state
```

## Factory Configuration

### Environment Settings
