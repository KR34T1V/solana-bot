## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TokenSniper**

   ```typescript
   class TokenSniper {
     private readonly config: SniperConfig;
     private readonly connection: Connection;
     private readonly detectedTokens: Set<string>;
     private readonly tradeHistory: TradeRecord[];
     private status: SystemStatus;
   }
   ```

2. **Provider System**

   ```typescript
   interface BaseProvider {
     getPrice(tokenMint: string): Promise<PriceData>;
     getOrderBook(tokenMint: string, limit?: number): Promise<MarketDepth>;
     getOHLCV(
       tokenMint: string,
       timeframe: number,
       limit: number,
     ): Promise<any>;
   }
   ```

3. **Risk Management**
   ```typescript
   interface RiskParameters {
     maxPositionSize: number;
     maxDailyExposure: number;
     stopLossLevel: number;
     profitTargets: {
       quick: number;
       target: number;
       moon: number;
     };
   }
   ```

### Type System

Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all major components:

```typescript
interface TokenValidation {
  creatorWalletAge: number;
  creatorTransactions: number;
  creatorLiquidity: number;
  initialSupply?: number;
  initialLiquidity: number;
  initialMarketCap?: number;
  holderDistribution?: number[];
  isHoneypot?: boolean;
  hasRenounced?: boolean;
  transferDelay?: number;
  taxAmount?: number;
}

interface SafetyScore {
  overall: number;
  factors: {
    contractSafety: number;
    creatorTrust: number;
    liquidityHealth: number;
    tradingPattern: number;
  };
  flags: {
    isHoneypot: boolean;
    hasRugPullRisk: boolean;
    hasMEVRisk: boolean;
    hasAbnormalActivity: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-bot.git

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Required
SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Optional
JUPITER_API_KEY=your_jupiter_api_key
LOG_LEVEL=info
CACHE_DURATION=30000

yarn type-check
```

## Testing Infrastructure

The project implements a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: DEX interactions and blockchain operations
- **Mock Providers**: Simulated market conditions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Latency and throughput testing

Test coverage requirements:

- Unit Tests: 95% coverage minimum
- Integration Tests: 85% coverage minimum
- E2E Tests: Critical user flows
- Mutation Testing: >80% score

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- Private key encryption at rest
- Secure key management
- Role-based access control

### Rate Limiting & Protection

- Request rate limiting per IP
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Error rate monitoring
- Automatic system pause on anomalies

### Data Security

- No sensitive data logging
- Secure RPC connection management
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
